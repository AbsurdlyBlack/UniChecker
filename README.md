# UniChecker
UniChecker is a discord bot made by me and my team during a hackathon at Codetivate which takes in data scraped from a website and  organizes it in a readable way to present it to the users.

The data was scraped from : https://www.macleans.ca/education/canadian-universities-minimum-entering-grades-by-faculty/

Note that the data is from a post from 2018 and may be currently innacurate. The goal of this project was to simply make it possible for highschool students who struggle to figure out minimum admission grades for their universities and faculties of interest to quickly find their information all in one sitting with the help of our bot, UniChecker.
